===========
CACTI (formerly CTCSU) is based on an LGPL audio player engine developed by Javazoom (http://www.javazoom.net/index.shtml). CACTI extends this engine into a GUI driven tool used to "code" and study the delivery of MI (Motivational Interviewing). MI and CACTI were initially developed at the University of New Mexico.  This project is being migrated from Google Code (https://code.google.com/p/ctcsu-player/).

Platform Notes: CACTI will work on any platform supporting a Sun JVM. However, it was designed for a specific user group utilizing the Windows XP platform, and the GUI works best on Windows XP utilizing 1024x768 or greater resolution. 

Due to the peculiarities of the javazoom player, CACTI versions 10.0.0 and prior require Java Runtime Environment 5.0 Update 22, which is not secure and is used at your own risk.  Java 5.0u22 can be downloaded from http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javasebusiness/downloads/java-archive-downloads-javase5-419410.html#jre-1.5.0_22-oth-JPR .  To see which version(s) of java are installed on your machine, you can visit http://www.javatester.org .  Users of modern version of Mac OS X may be unable to use this version of CACTI.
